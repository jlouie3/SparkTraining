RDD Notes

    RDD's are partitioned across nodes. Each node has 1 partition. can hold RDD in memory as long as size of data
    does not surpass total memory of all nodes in cluster.

    RDD's are read-only/immutable.

    Only 2 types of operations: Transformations and Actions.
       Transforms: RDD --> RDD, loading, filtering, sorting, any change in data, etc
       Actions: Reads, counts, sums, anything that demands an actual value is an Action. An Action will cause all
       transformations in queue to execute

    Lineage: RDD knows where is came from. Each RDD only contains metadata until an action is called, at which point
    the final RDD will materialize. Lineage is traced back to the source which allows RDD's to have resilience and
    lazy evaluation.
